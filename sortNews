# SortNews -- save a list of news articles to be saved in order (like, maybe if
# they're uuencoded) to ~/News/xxx and this will generate a file that you can
# use to generate the correct command lines to be copied (like, on a sun).
# The new file is called ~/News/New/NUMBERS, and highlighting and copying a 
# line at a time of it into rn will save the stuff in proper order.
